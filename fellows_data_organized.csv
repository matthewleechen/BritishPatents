Diligently collected the material from egg sacs of spiders, then had a large number of them washed, boiled and cleansed, then allowed to dry. Sacs were carded with fine combs and worked into slender thread of a pleasing grey colour. Two pairs of stockings and gloves made from this natural silk were presented to the 'Academie Royale des Sciences'. This accomplishment proved to be so sensational that in the following year the Academie commissioned Reamur to investigate the possibility of extensive uses of spider silk. After a thorough study however, he concluded that there was little likelihood that such spider silk as was available in Europe could become a profitable industry.

Erskine immediately set about trying to make the operation profitable. His efforts were cut short by the Revolutionary War. Erskine was sympathetic to the American cause, but worried that he might lose his workers to the army, he organized them into a militia and was appointed a militia captain in August of 1775.    Because of its remoteness from the enemy, Ringwood was the only permanent barracks for revolutionary troops in New Jersey, and its forges supplied much needed ammunition and weapons.

Sought and obtained permission to travel as a palliative to his ailments. Holman crafted a cane which was metal tipped, and which he held like a paint brush, so he could tap his way through foreign lands. Circumnavigated the globe, visiting Siberia, Tasmania and previously unexplored areas of the African interior. He rode on horseback and walked; he sailed on merchant ships and rode on rudimentary, horse-drawn carts. Holman's accounts of his trips made him a popular author in England, although he was attacked by John Dundas Cochrane, the Pedestrian Traveller whose books did not sell so well in comparison.

The survey would take up 25 years of his life and would map a huge area -almost 2,400 km from Cape Comorin in the south to the Himalayas in the north. It is said the Everest was relentless in his pursuit of accuracy and that he made countless adaptions to the surveying equipment, the methods and the calculations involved. Seven years after he wasa appointed superintendent of the Great Trigonometrical Survey, George Everest was also made Surveyor General in India. It is known that Everest travelled to the foothills of the Himalayas as part of his work but there is no firm evidence that he actually saw the summit of the mountain which bears his name.

By way of Philadelphia and Kentucky, Audubon settled in Louisiana in 1821. There he gave lessons to plantation belles and spent long days shooting birds and then painting them.

In every case, Audubon observed the natural setings and created a scientific record still of value today.    When he travelled to Europe in 1826 seeking a publisher, he was hailed as 'The American Woodsman'.

Went with Edward Frankland to Marburg in 1848 to study in Robert Bunsen's laboratory for a Ph.D. where he first heard of diamagnetism. In 1859, his laboratory experiments showed that water vapour and carbon dioxide absorb infra-red radiation and that they could therefore affect the climate of the Earth. As soon as his paper was published in 1861 in the 'Proceedings of the Royal Society', he put out a press release for the London newspapers explaining that this result implied that all past climate changes were now understood and all future climate changes could be predicted simply from a knowledge of the concentrations of these 'greenhouse' gases.
