        "This notebook was designed for training in Google Colab Pro. It is **not** recommended to run this notebook on the Colab free plan. This notebook's training loop was originally run using Colab Pro on 1 Nvidia A100 (40GB) GPU. Training is both compute and time-intensive: the process consumed approximately 15-20 compute credits per hour, and the Faster-RCNN and Mask-RCNN (ResNet-50 backbone) models took approximately one full day (~12 hours) to train to 100,000 iterations. This is going to vary significantly depending on the quality of your input images that you need to load into GPU memory: I compressed them to 20% of their original size.\n",
